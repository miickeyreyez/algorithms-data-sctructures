This repo contains algorithms and data structures implementations.

# Big O Notation

Algorithms complexity, determine the perform of our code.
Runtime of an algorithm given an input.

# Complexity

Algorithms have two differents complexities: Space and Time.

# How to solve a problem?
- Understan dthe problem
- Explore concrete examples
- Break it down
- Solve or simplify

# Problem solving patterns

- Frequency counter
- Multiple pointers
- Sliding window
- Divide and conquer

# Recursion

- A process that call itself
- Uses a call stack
- Function invoked -> pushed
- Function returned -> pop
- Base case

# Search
- Linear search
- Binary search (Array must be order)
