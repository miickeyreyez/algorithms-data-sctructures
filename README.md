This repo contains algorithms and data structures implementations.

# Complexity

Algorithms have two differents complexities: Space and Time.

# Problem solving patterns

- Frequency counter
- Multiple pointers
- Sliding window
- Divide and conquer

# Recursion

- A process that call itself
- Uses a call stack
- Function invoked -> pushed
- Function returned -> pop
- Base case
